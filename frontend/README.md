# PostgreScrutiniser Frontend

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Generating API code

Code can be generated by either using the `.yaml` files located directly in `backend/api` the `generator.sh` script uses the latter to avoid possible errors.
If running in a new environment, do the following:
```
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel
```

Otherwise make sure the backend application is running and then execute the commands below (files will be generated incorrectly if you don't change to the `openapi` directory first):
```
cd src/openapi
./generator.sh
```

### Generation issues

Due to time restraints, I decided to write a script and manually move files around instead of using `openapi-generator-cli` properly. Will come back to this at a later time. The paragraphs below explain issues encountered while trying to automatically generate openapi code.

#### .openapi-generator-ignore does not work

`.openapi-generator-ignore` seems to be ignored. TO DO: implement a solution for generating only the necessary code. At the moment - remove the rest manually. Also need to look into only generating functional APIs:
- https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/customization/#selective-generation
- https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/typescript-axios/
- https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/globals/

#### Too much code

At the moment, the `openapi-generator-cli` command tool creates too many interfaces. Including a class interface. In reality, we only need a functional programming interface.

#### Incorrect BASE_URL

Currently `generator.sh` simply replaces `BASE_URL` in `base.ts` with our remote backend source. Should be able to specify from the command line what remote backend `openapi-generator-cli` should use. Alternatively, an easier solution would be to fix the backend's `.yaml` files with correct host entries.
