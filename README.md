# PostgreScrutiniser

PostgreSQL configuration management tool, inspired by [MySQLTuner](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl).

This is the code repository for my final Bachelor project. The backend and frontend are separated into two different folders accordingly and each has documentation specific to it in those folders.
